**TITLE;**  <br>
Tesla Stocks Analysis Dashboard

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**  <br>
The "Tesla Stocks Analysis Dashboard" repository contains a comprehensive stock analysis project developed using Power BI. The project aimed to analyze stock data from multiple sources and present insights through intuitive visualizations and interactive dashboards.

**OBJECTIVE:**  <br>
Evaluate the performance of Tesla stocks in terms of key performance indicators (KPIs). Identify trends, patterns and anomalies in the company's performance data over time. Generate actionable insights to inform data-driven decision-making. Enhance data transparency and accessibiity for stakeholders.

**DATA EXTRACTION:**  <br>
Aggregated stock data was extracted from datasets containing Tesla stock price data categorized by monthly, yearly, and quarterly intervals.

**DATA CLEANSING:**  <br> 
The column distribution, column profile and column quality was elucidated from the view ribbon of the power query editor. This was done to ascertain and check for the possibility of errors, null values, empty spaces, data uniqueness and distinctiveness, outliers, and inconsistencies.

**DATA TRANSFORMATION**  <br>
Transformation was done on the already cleansed data. The data had a lot of issues and required thorough cleansing, formatting, styling and re-organisation. This was done with a very high level of professionalism in order to maintain the integrity and originality of the data. The Transformed Data was then saved and made ready for the data modelling.

**DATA MODELING:**  <br> 
Designed a robust data model, incorporating various tables, relationships, and calculated columns for analysis. Power BI's data modeling capabilities were used to create relationships between different datasets. Data hierachy and date table creation using DAX was done,enabling a holistic view of the organization's performance.

**VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS:**  <br> 
Created interactive visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps, to represent key performance, trends, and regional comparisons. These visuals allowed for easy interpretation of performance trends. The core focus of the project was on analyzing performance data over time. This involved creating time-based visualizations to track changes, seasonality, and growth in various KPIs. Key performance indicators (KPIs) were analyzed over time to access the company's overall performance in the stocks region.

**DASHBOARD CREATION:**  <br> 
Constructed a user-friendly dashboard presenting KPIs, stock trends, and performance metrics.
Filtering and Slicing: Implemented dynamic filtering and slicing options for users to drill down into specific data points. This dashboard was developed to present the insights in an intuitive and interactive manner thereby enabling users to gain a deep understanding of the company's performance.

**PROJECT OUTCOMES**  <br>

Clear Insights: The project provided a clear picture of how Tesla Stocks had performed over the specified time period. allowing stakeholders to make informed decisions based on historical data.

Improved Decision-Making: The interactive Power BI dashboard empowered decision-makers to identify areas for improvement, allocate resources effectively, and set realistic performance targets.

Data Transparency: The project enhanced data transparency within the organization, making it easier for employees at all levels to access and understand the company's performance data.

Data-Driven Culture: The project contributed to fostering a data-driven culture within Tesla Stocks, emphasizing the importance of data analysis in strategic decision-making.

In conclusion, the "Tesla Stocks Analysis Dashboard" project successfully harnessed the capabilities of Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights. This project not only provided valuable historical performance insights but also paved the way for a more data-informed approach to managing the company's operations.
